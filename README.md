Dataset Description: We are sharing an open-source dataset of de-identified patients. Our prospective observational study of 100 preterm infants undergoing 252 ROP screening examinations addresses this important clinical question. We systematically evaluated the impact of oral sucrose and pacifier use—both individually and in combination—on validated pain scores and objective physiologic measures during binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy. Missing data is denoted by a blank cell or NA.
